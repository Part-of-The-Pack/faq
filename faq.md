Hello there,

And welcome to this Frequently Asked Questions document about The Pack!

Given that you’re here, it looks like you are one of our early users… and we’re excited to have you use our platform!

This document is made to make your life easier by answering any questions you might have while using The Pack.

If a question you have is not included here, please let us know by either inserting a comment (click insert on the menu and select “comment”) or by sending an email to **helpdesk@partofthepack.com.** 

## What is The Pack again?

The Pack is the platform that helps Artist Teams do Business; whether you’re an artist, an artist manager, a freelance sound engineer, a tour manager or anyone else involved in the music business - we are here for you.

Our focus is to help you easily plan tour budgets through The Pack Tour and make transactions frictionless through The Pack Pay.


## What is The Pack Pay?

The Pack Pay is our very first product, which aims to help make transactions easy. It was built based on the firsthand observation that artist teams and freelancers spend a lot of time emailing invoices back and forth and making payments manually through bank accounts. We want to help them (you!) claim that time back so you can spend it on crowd-pleasing activities instead :).


## Something isn’t working for me, how do I get support?

Oh no! We’re here to help you - just drop us an email on [helpdesk@partofthepack.com](mailto:helpdesk@partofthepack.com)


## I have a request for a new feature or functionality, what do I do?

Awesome, we’d love to hear your thoughts! 

Please send us an email at [ihaveanidea@partofthepack.com](mailto:ihaveanidea@partofthepack.com) and tell us all about it please!. 


## Why am I being referred to something called ‘Stripe’ during the setup of my profile?

Stripe is the trusted service we use to handle payments in the backend. It has an excellent reputation for being a secure payments platform, and many companies like booking.com and ticketswap use it. You can find out more about stripe on [www.stripe.com](www.stripe.com). 

If you need help with Stripe, their help center can be found at [https://support.stripe.com/](https://support.stripe.com/) 


## Why do I need to fill out all those fields on Stripe?

In order to be able to receive payments, you need to complete your Stripe signup. 

Stripe needs to collect those fields to comply with the EU regulation regarding money transfers. Given that Stripe also needs to comply with e.g. GDPR, we are confident your data is safe with them. You can find out more about their privacy approach at [https://support.stripe.com/topics/privacy](https://support.stripe.com/topics/privacy) 


## I have a problem with verification of my Stripe account, now what?

We’re sorry to hear it!

This[ link](https://support.stripe.com/topics/verification) on the Stripe help center should have all the information you’re looking for. If it doesn’t, please let us know so we can help you to figure it out!


## How much does it cost to use The Pack? {#how-much-does-it-cost-to-use-the-pack}

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">In short</span>: access to the platform is free; we only charge a fee if you _pay_ invoices, no costs if you _get paid_.


### Getting paid {#getting-paid}

Getting paid by your clients is 100% free: you can send and receive payment requests and invoices for free, and we won’t charge you anything..


### Paying {#paying}

When you pay through The Pack Pay, we charge a 1% platform cost. This amount helps us keep the servers up and running and supports new feature development like e.g. the 2 minute budget beta.

In addition, depending on the payment type you choose, you’ll be charged a fee by the payment provider that’s used. 

We transparently show you the fees on the checkout page, and you will see that when you select different payment types, the fees change. We try to make it cheaper for you by ranking the payment types available to you by price (the cheapest option first!).

We only keep the 1%, the other fees go directly to the payment providers.


## How long does it take before the payments I make leave my account? {#how-long-does-it-take-before-the-payments-i-make-leave-my-account}

This depends on the type of payment you choose when checking out.


### Card payments {#card-payments}


    The short summary is: we don’t do anything differently with card payments than what you’re already used to on other platforms.  \
With Card Payments, the transaction is processed instantly. However, as you likely know, when you use a debit card the money leaves your account instantly, while on a credit card the cost is booked to the credit card account but the settlement thereof depends entirely on how you’ve set it up.


### Bank Debits (e.g SEPA, ACH,...) {#bank-debits-e-g-sepa-ach}


    Bank Debit payments basically allow the business you want to pay to directly pull funds from your account, after you have authorized them to do so. \
One of the advantages of this method is that the transaction costs are generally lower than for e.g. credit cards.


    Because the banks need to process the request, it takes a few days extra before funds leave your account; for SEPA and ACH for example it adds about 5 days to the timeline.


    All information on how Bank Debits work can be found [here](https://stripe.com/en-es/guides/introduction-to-bank-debits) on the Strip help center. An overview of timelines per Bank Debit type can be found [here](https://stripe.com/en-es/guides/introduction-to-bank-debits#comparison-of-global-bank-debit-methods).


## How long does it take before payments made to me reach my account? {#how-long-does-it-take-before-payments-made-to-me-reach-my-account}

We know you want your money as soon as possible, so we’re trying to ensure this doesn’t take too long! There are a few different answers to this question though, so please read on.


### A normal timeline depends on your country. {#a-normal-timeline-depends-on-your-country}


    The exact amount of days between a payment is made and the time it hits your bank account varies by country. Generally, it’s about 3 days. You can read the detailed information about this on the Stripe help center [here](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts#standard-payout-timing).


### The first time is different… {#the-first-time-is-different…}


    The first time a transaction is made to you on The Pack, our trusted partner Stripe needs to verify a few things in the background to ensure it’s a legitimate payment and no fraud is happening. As a result, the first time it takes between 7 and 14 days before the money will hit your account. This _only _happens the very first time, and after that we’re on to approximately 3 days (as explained above)


### Bank Debits (SEPA, ACH,...) are a bit special. {#bank-debits-sepa-ach-are-a-bit-special}


    When your client pays you through a Bank Debit, they basically authorize your bank to take the amount directly from their bank account.


    Because the banks need to process the request, it takes a few days extra before money actually hits your account. For SEPA and ACH for example it adds about 5 days to the timeline.


    We keep you informed of every step in the timeline in the following ways:  \



        _Step 1_: When your customer has initiated the Bank Debit process, we send you an email to let you know the payment is processing. You will also see the status ‘processing’ next to the payment request on The Pack Pay. \



        _Step 2_: When the processing is done about 5 days later, you will get a second email to tell you that you’ve been paid. And, we will mark the payment request on The Pack Pay as ‘paid’


## What do I do if payments are not reaching me, although I’ve waited the time described above? {#what-do-i-do-if-payments-are-not-reaching-me-although-i’ve-waited-the-time-described-above}

In very rare circumstances, a payment is held back until Stripe verifies some of your information.

To determine if this is happening and solve this, there are 3 things you can do:



1. First: Check your inbox to see if you’ve received an email from Stripe directly with next steps.
2. Alternatively, log in to The Pack, go to ‘settings’ > ‘my brands’ > select the brand you’re waiting on a payment for > click ‘Go to Stripe’. This will log you into stripe and tell you what they need in order to unblock your payment.
3. If all else fails, contact [support@stripe.com](mailto:support@stripe.com).  


## Can I invite other people to use The Pack? {#can-i-invite-other-people-to-use-the-pack}

Absolutely (and we’re grateful if you do!).

You can either refer them to our website so they can sign up directly, or if you want to initiate a transaction with them directly even before they are signed up, that’s possible too. 

You’ll notice an ‘invite new user’ button when you click ‘select who you want to pay’. 


## Is The Pack available in any other languages? {#is-the-pack-available-in-any-other-languages}

Currently we only support English. If you think it would be valuable for us to explore adding an additional language, please let us know which one! Drop us an email at ihaveanidea@partofhtepack.com.


## Can I add invoices or proof of expenses to my payments? {#can-i-add-invoices-or-proof-of-expenses-to-my-payments}

Yes you can!

You can add as many attachments as you like, actually.

So if you want to add up all your expenses to one big amount, and then upload all the receipts to prove those expenses in one go (instead of making a lot of smaller requests), you can totally do that.


## Someone requested a payment from me, but I don’t agree with it. What should I do? {#someone-requested-a-payment-from-me-but-i-don’t-agree-with-it-what-should-i-do}

You have the ability to either decline the payment completely, or to request changes directly on the platform. Easy!


## I have requested a payment from someone, but I just remembered I need to make changes. Can I do that? {#i-have-requested-a-payment-from-someone-but-i-just-remembered-i-need-to-make-changes-can-i-do-that}

Absolutely. Just click into the payment request, click ‘update payment request’, and make any necessary changes. You can also cancel the payment request completely by clicking (_wait for it)_ ‘cancel’.


## I have approved a payment, but I need to recall it because I made a mistake. What now? {#i-have-approved-a-payment-but-i-need-to-recall-it-because-i-made-a-mistake-what-now}

Absolutely. Even when a payment is approved, you can still request changes by clicking the ‘request changes’ button and filling out the changes you’re looking for in the open text field. 

Alternatively, you can also still decline the payment by clicking the ‘decline’ button. 


## Is there a limit on the amount of transactions I can request or pay? {#is-there-a-limit-on-the-amount-of-transactions-i-can-request-or-pay}

No limit whatsoever - feel free to go wild!


## How do the ‘payment terms’ work? {#how-do-the-‘payment-terms’-work}

Example of an answer to that question.


## _What is the difference between a User_, a_ Band_ or Brand and an Organization_?_ {#what-is-the-difference-between-a-user-a-band-or-brand-and-an-organization}


### What are users? {#what-are-users}

A **User** is what you need to log in to The Pack; it is how we know who you are.

For example: Paul McCartney is a user, who registers with paul@thebeatles.com and password YellowSubmarine


### What are organizations?  {#what-are-organizations}

An **Organization** is a financial entity; it is registered, and has a bank account. Users can have access to multiple organizations, and when you complete the onboarding process on Stripe, you create an organization.

For example: The Beatles Incorporated is a company. Note that Paul can belong to multiple companies; he also has Mccartney Limited as a company, that he uses for his solo work.


### What is a B(r)and? {#what-is-a-b-r-and}

A Band or Brand (We like to call this ‘**B(r)and**’) is the name under which organizations operate and want to be found by others on The Pack. Organizations can have multiple bands or brands.

For Example: ‘The Beatles’ is the band under which ‘The Beatles Incorporated’ operates. Paul’s organization ‘Mccartney Limited’ goes to market under 2 different brand names: ‘Paul Mccartney Solo’ for his solo albums and ‘DJ Paul’ when he’s DJ’ing at techno raves. 


## I use a different entity (company) to book incomes from my band in different countries; how do I make this happen on The Pack? {#i-use-a-different-entity-company-to-book-incomes-from-my-band-in-different-countries-how-do-i-make-this-happen-on-the-pack}

No worries, we have heard this one before!

For example, we have European bands on The Pack who have a separate entity for their business in the United States, which could be interesting for tax reasons. 

To make this happen on The Pack, you should simply set up a company for every separate entity you operate, and create a uniquely named band under every company. 

<p style="text-align: right">
For example, user Till Lindeman would create ‘Rammstein EU inc’ and ‘Rammstein US inc’ and create band ‘Rammstein EU’ and ‘Rammstein US’ under each respective company. Whenever there’s a US tour, Till would make sure all transactions happen with Rammstein US.</p>
