When you pay through The Pack Pay, we charge a 1% platform cost. This amount helps us keep the servers up and running and supports new feature development like e.g. the 2 minute budget beta.

In addition, depending on the payment type you choose, you’ll be charged a fee by the payment provider that’s used. 

We transparently show you the fees on the checkout page, and you will see that when you select different payment types, the fees change. We try to make it cheaper for you by ranking the payment types available to you by price (the cheapest option first!).

We only keep the 1%, the other fees go directly to the payment providers.
