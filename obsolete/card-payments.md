The short summary is: we don’t do anything differently with card payments than what you’re already used to on other platforms.

With Card Payments, the transaction is processed instantly. However, as you likely know, when you use a debit card the money leaves your account instantly, while on a credit card the cost is booked to the credit card account but the settlement thereof depends entirely on how you’ve set it up.
