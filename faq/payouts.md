We know you want your money as soon as possible, so we’re trying to ensure this doesn’t take too long! There are a few different answers to this question though, so please read on.

#### 3 different things need to happen.

* First, when a payment is made to you, this goes from the payor's bank account to your Stripe account. This step is almost instant.
* Second, Stripe will initiate a payout from your Stripe account to your bank account. This depends on your settings, but the standard setting for The Pack is 1 day.
* Third, Stripe and your bank need to jointly process that transfer. The timeline for this depends on your country and bank; in our experience this takes about 3 days but it can be a little bit longer in some cases. Read on for more info.


#### A normal timeline depends on your country.

The exact amount of days between a payment is made and the time it hits your bank account varies by country. Generally, it’s about 3 days. You can read the detailed information about this on the Stripe help center [here](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts#standard-payout-timing).

#### The first time is different… 

The first time a transaction is made to you on The Pack, our trusted partner Stripe needs to verify a few things in the background to ensure it’s a legitimate payment and no fraud is happening. 

As a result, the first time it can take up to 7 (and in extremely exceptional cases up to 14) days before the money will hit your account. This *only* happens the very first time, and after that we’re on to approximately 3 days (as explained above)

#### Bank Debits (SEPA, ACH,...) are a bit special. 

When your client pays you through a Bank Debit, they basically authorize your bank to take the amount directly from their bank account.

Because the banks need to process the request, it may take a few days extra before money hits your Stripe account. For SEPA and ACH for example it can add about 5 days to the timeline.

#### We keep you informed.

We send you 2 emails to keep you informed of the process:

* When your customer has initiated the payment, we send you an email to let you know the payment is processing. You will also see the status ‘processing’ next to the payment request on The Pack Pay.
* When the processing is done about 5 days later, you will get a second email to tell you that you’ve been paid. And, we will mark the payment request on The Pack Pay as ‘paid’.
* When Stripe has received your payment, we will send you a second email to tell you the money has hit your Stripe account. And, we will mark the payment request on The Pack Pay as ‘paid’, because the money now is officially "yours"; your customer has paid you.
