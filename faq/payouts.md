We know you want your money as soon as possible, so we’re trying to ensure this doesn’t take too long! There are a few different answers to this question though, so please read on.

#### A normal timeline depends on your country.

The exact amount of days between a payment is made and the time it hits your bank account varies by country. Generally, it’s about 3 days. You can read the detailed information about this on the Stripe help center [here](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts#standard-payout-timing).

#### The first time is different… 

The first time a transaction is made to you on The Pack, our trusted partner Stripe needs to verify a few things in the background to ensure it’s a legitimate payment and no fraud is happening. As a result, the first time it takes between 7 and 14 days before the money will hit your account. This *only* happens the very first time, and after that we’re on to approximately 3 days (as explained above)

#### Bank Debits (SEPA, ACH,...) are a bit special. {#bank-debits-sepa-ach-are-a-bit-special}

When your client pays you through a Bank Debit, they basically authorize your bank to take the amount directly from their bank account.

Because the banks need to process the request, it takes a few days extra before money actually hits your account. For SEPA and ACH for example it adds about 5 days to the timeline.

We keep you informed of every step in the timeline in the following ways: 

1. When your customer has initiated the Bank Debit process, we send you an email to let you know the payment is processing. You will also see the status ‘processing’ next to the payment request on The Pack Pay.

2. When the processing is done about 5 days later, you will get a second email to tell you that you’ve been paid. And, we will mark the payment request on The Pack Pay as ‘paid’.
