As you will have noticed, you can add multiple members to your brand. On top, you can give them certain "rights", meaning that they'll be able to do certain things and won't be allowed to do others.
This is a handy feature for when you want to collaborate with different people on a tour, but don't want to allow all of them to execute payments for example.

The Pack has access rights on 3 levels:
1. Brand level: to change things on the brand itself.
2. Payment level: to execute things related to payments.
3. Tour level: to do things related to tours.

You can find the different access rights explained per level below:

**Brand**:
* Admin: Everything, including changing all company info and setting up Stripe accounts. Highest level of access.
* Write: Changing company info and adding members. Not able to add or change Stripe accounts.
* Read: See the brand details, but can't make any changes. Lowest level of access.

**Pay**:
* Pay: Pay and request payments; highest level of access.
* Approve: See payment requests coming in and approve them. Not allowed to execute the actual payment.
* View: See payments come in, but no access to the payment details (e.g. invoices / attachments)
* No access: Nothing at all. Lowest level of access, obviously.

**Tour**:
* Manage: Able to do anything, including removing tours. Highest level of access.
* Edit: Edit the tour details, but not able to remove the tour.
* View: Will be able to view tours but can't make any changes.
* No access: Won't even be able to see any of the tours created.
