### Why is the app flickering and not loading properly?

If you're experiencing flickering in the app or it remains in a loading state, this may be due to connectivity issues. Follow the steps below to troubleshoot:

#### Quick Fixes

- **Restart your modem and router:** This can resolve temporary network glitches and connectivity issues.
- **Check your Internet speed:** Use a speed test to verify your connection is stable and fast enough for the app's requirements.
- **Switch networks:** If possible, try connecting to a different WiFi network or use mobile data to see if the issue is related to your current network.

#### Clearing Cache and Data

- **Clear your browser cache:** Use the settings menu in your browser to clear your browsing data. This can often resolve loading issues.
- **Perform a hard refresh:** On most browsers, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl` + `F5` on Windows or `Cmd` + `Shift` + `R` on macOS.

#### Advanced Troubleshooting

- **Change DNS servers:** Sometimes, your ISP's DNS servers may have issues. Change your DNS to a public service like Google DNS (`8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`) or Cloudflare (`1.1.1.1`).
- **Disable VPNs or proxies:** If you're using a VPN or a proxy, temporarily disable it to check if it's causing the issue.

#### For Persistent Problems

- **Check for updates:** Ensure that your browser and any relevant apps are updated to the latest version.
- **Restart your device:** Rebooting your device can fix unexpected device-specific anomalies.

#### If Problems Continue

If after following these steps, you still encounter issues, it might be a problem with the app's server or a specific service within the app. Please contact support with:

- The time and date the problem occurred.
- The type of device and browser you're using.
- A description of the issue and any error messages you may have received.
- Any steps you've already taken to try and solve the issue.
