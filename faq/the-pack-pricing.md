In short, access to the platform is free.

We only charge a fee if you _pay_ invoices, no costs if you _get paid_.

 


#### Using The Pack Tour...

... is 100% free, no strings attached.

 


#### Getting paid on The Pack Pay

Getting paid by your clients is 100% free: you can send and receive payment requests and invoices for free, and we won’t charge you anything.

 


#### Paying on The Pack Pay

When you pay through The Pack Pay, we charge a 1% platform cost. This amount helps us keep the servers up and running and supports new feature development like e.g. improvements to The Pack Tour etc.

In addition, depending on the payment type you choose, you’ll be charged a fee by the payment provider that’s used.

We transparently show you the fees on the checkout page, and you will see that when you select different payment types, the fees change. We try to make it cheaper for you by ranking the payment types available to you by price (the cheapest option first!).

We only keep the 1%, the other fees go directly to the payment providers.
