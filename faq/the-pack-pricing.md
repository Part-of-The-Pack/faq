The Pack charges a monthly subscription price.
You can find our pricing [here] (https://www.partofthepack.com/pricing)

The right price is dependent on how many admin users you want on your b(r)and, how many agreements you'll share with crew or suppliers each month, how many docs like invoices and expense receipts you'll add, and how many free payments you need included in your package.


#### The Pack is free for invited crew members & suppliers...

100% free, no strings attached.
You can see and accept agreements, add documents, request payments,... all for free.
 

#### Getting paid on The Pack Pay is free

Getting paid by your clients is 100% free: you can send and receive payment requests and invoices for free, and we won’t charge you anything.


#### Paying on The Pack Pay

When you pay through The Pack Pay, and you have no free payments included in your plan (or you ran out) we charge a 1% platform cost. This amount helps us keep the servers up and running and supports new feature development like e.g. improvements to The Pack Tour etc.

In addition, depending on the payment type you choose, you’ll be charged a fee by the payment provider that’s used.

We transparently show you the fees on the checkout page, and you will see that when you select different payment types, the fees change. We try to make it cheaper for you by ranking the payment types available to you by price (the cheapest option first!).

We only keep the 1%, the other fees go directly to the payment providers.

#### Transfer plans between brands
Are you a management or tour management agency working with many artists? Maximize your subscription's value by switching your plans between artists based on their touring cycles. We don't want you to pay for a brand that's not actively touring; just ask us to transfer the plan to a different brand and we'll take care of it.
There is a limit of one transfer per month.

#### Pause subscriptions whenever you need
We understand the unique rhythm of the touring industry. That’s why we don’t mind getting put on hold when you don’t need us.
Just let us know right before the billing cycle starts again, and we'll put your plan on hold. You'll still have access to all your data.
