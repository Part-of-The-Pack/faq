No worries, we have heard this one before!

For example, we have European bands on The Pack who have a separate entity for their business in the United States, which could be interesting for tax reasons.

To make this happen on The Pack, you should simply set up a company for every separate entity you operate, and create a uniquely named b(r)and under every company.

For example, user Till Lindeman would create ‘Rammstein EU inc’ and ‘Rammstein US inc’ and create band ‘Rammstein EU’ and ‘Rammstein US’ under each respective company.
Whenever there’s a US tour, Till would make sure all transactions happen with Rammstein US.
