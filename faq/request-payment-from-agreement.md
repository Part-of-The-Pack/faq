Excellent question! 
We tried to make this really easy for everyone involved.

The steps are the following:

1. Open the agreement you want to get paid for.
2. Make sure the agreement is correct and up-to-date. (For example, have you added your expenses?)
3. Click "ask to get paid" on top. A popup will open with the following options:

   * _What did you sell_: this is prefilled with the name of the artist, the tour title, the role you got and whether or not expenses are uploaded. It serves to let the payor know what you're requesting a payment for.
   * _Who should pay_: prefilled with the b(r)and that made the agreement / tour. This is editable, in case e.g. management is using a different entity to pay you with.
   * _Who should receive_: prefilled with your b(r)and that got the invitation. You can edit this, but you can only pick from the list of brands you have access to. This is useful for example when you're using different brands to receive your wages and per diems.
   * _Amount_: prefilled with the full agreement amount + expenses. This is editable as well, which is useful for partial payments - for example if you want to get paid on a weekly basis during the tour, you can edit the amount so it only includes that week's wages.
   * _Reference_: in case you want to add a PO number for example.
   * _Extra details_: prefilled with the agreement name and the expense categories that were added. Editable to give more context (e.g. if you're requesting weekly payments, this is the place to make it crystal clear!)
   * _Attachments_: this is where you can add invoices. Don't add expense items; those can be added to the agreement [through the expense button](https://app.partofthepack.com/faq/invoice-proof-of-expense). In that way, your expenses are added to the tour budget.

5. Click "request payment" and sit back until the money rolls in.

If you'd rather watch a 3 minute video explaining how it works, here you go:
