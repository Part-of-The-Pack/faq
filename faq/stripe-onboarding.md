In order to be able to receive payments, you need to complete your Stripe signup. 

Stripe needs to collect those fields to comply with the EU regulation regarding money transfers. Given that Stripe also needs to comply with e.g. GDPR, we are confident your data is safe with them. You can find out more about their privacy approach at [https://support.stripe.com/topics/privacy](https://support.stripe.com/topics/privacy)
