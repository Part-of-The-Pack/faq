The Pack Pay aims to make transactions easy.

It was built based on the firsthand observation that artist teams and freelancers spend a lot of time emailing invoices back and forth and making payments manually through bank accounts. We want to help them (you!) claim that time back so you can spend it on crowd-pleasing activities instead :)
