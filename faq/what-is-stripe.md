Stripe is the trusted service we use to handle payments in the backend. It has an excellent reputation for being a secure payments platform, and many companies like booking.com and ticketswap use it. You can find out more about stripe on [www.stripe.com](www.stripe.com). 

If you need help with Stripe, their help center can be found at [https://support.stripe.com/](https://support.stripe.com/)
