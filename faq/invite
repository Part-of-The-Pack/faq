# Some people I work with are not yet on The Pack. How can I do business with them?
One of the best things about The Pack, is that all of your agreements are in one place. If you're working with a crew member, supplier, etc, that is not yet on The Pack, it is best to invite that person on The Pack.

## How can I invite someone to The Pack?
You can invite someone to use The Pack in different ways:

 - If you make an agreement for someone who is not yet on The Pack, you get the chance to invite him. When the user accepts the invitation, he is automatically linked to your agreement.
 - If you want to pay someone who is not yet on The Pack, you can invite that person directly from your payment. When the user accepts the invitation, you can proceed with paying him/her.
 - Do you want someone to work together with you on the same b(r)and? Invite this person to become a part of your b(r)and.

## Why would my coworkers want to join The Pack?
The Pack makes tour life much easier for every person involved in the tour. That includes the ones you invite on the platform.

And no worries about money: The Pack is free to use. We only ask for a 1% fee on every payment a payor makes through the platform.
