In very rare circumstances, a payment is held back until Stripe verifies some of your information.

To determine if this is happening and solve this, there are 3 things you can do:

1. First: Check your inbox to see if you’ve received an email from Stripe directly with next steps.
2. Alternatively, log in to The Pack, go to ‘settings’ > ‘my brands’ > select the brand you’re waiting on a payment for > click ‘Go to Stripe’. This will log you into stripe and tell you what they need in order to unblock your payment.
3. If all else fails, contact [support@stripe.com](mailto:support@stripe.com).
