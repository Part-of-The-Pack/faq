## As a Crew Member, These Are the Key Steps:

1. **Get Invited to an Agreement**  
   (Basically a contract between you and the tour organizer to take up a certain role)

2. **Click Accept** and **Sign Up** after you've seen the basics of the agreement - leading you to create a **user**.

3. **Verify** Your Email Address

4. **Create Your Account** and **Your Brand(s)** on The Pack by filling out some info.

5. **Link One of Your Brand(s) to the Agreement**

6. **Go to "Tour"** and Find the Agreement Under "Tours I Am a Part Of"

7. **Accept, Decline** or Give **Feedback** on the Agreement

8. **Add Receipts** for Expenses You Make (During the Tour)

9. Set Up Your **Stripe Account** (Optional)

10. **Request to Get Paid and Add Your Invoice**
