Agreements are agreements (duh) between the organizer of a tour and a crew member regarding the planning of a crew member and the fees that crew member will be paid.

There are 2 parts to it:
#### Planning
In the planning part, you can plan a crew member in 2 ways:
1. You can indicate the day types that a crew member will be working on (for example, someone is only working on show days)
2. You can indicate where the crew members' planning deviates from the tour schedule (for example, someone is working every day type of a tour, except for the last show day and travel day because of earlier commitments. You can indicate in the calendar that these 2 days need to be removed from the planning for this specific crew member.

#### Agreement details
In this section, you make the monetary agreements between you and the crew member through agreement items.
Agreement items are automatically linked to the *planning* of a crew member, and are built based on different *types of tour days*. 

For example, you can add an agreement item specifically for show days or travel days, after which the platform will automatically calculate the totals based on the calendar of tour days you have created, and the tour days this person is actually planned in for.

You can add multiple agreement items to an agreement. We most commonly see a setup with:
- "Show + advance fee"; linked to every **show** day
- "Dayrate"; linked to every day on the tour schedule except showdays
- "Per Diem"; linked to every day on tour

You can use the prefills with the most common agreement items, or you can custom-create your own.

Lastly, if you have agreements with a crew member or supplier that are based on a flat, fixed fee, independent of the type of day, you can add agreement items called "fixed" or "rental" and indicate the total amount.
