Agreements are agreements (duh) between the organizer of a tour and a crew member or supplier regarding the planning and the fees that they will be paid.
To create an agreement, you can simply add an expense to a tour. 
Once an expense is added, you can add a partner to the expense to convert it to an agreement.
This will allow you to send the details over to that partner, so they can accept it. Once they do, you're in business!

An agreement has 3 parts to it:

#### Budget 
In this section, you set up the monetary details between you and the crew member through expense items.
Agreement items are automatically linked to the *planning* of a crew member, and are built based on different *types of tour days*. 

For example, you can add an expense item specifically for show days or travel days, after which the platform will automatically calculate the totals based on the calendar of tour days you have created, and the tour days this person is actually planned in for.

You can add multiple agreement items to an agreement. We most commonly see a setup with:
- "Show + advance fee"; linked to every **show** day
- "Dayrate"; linked to every day on the tour schedule except showdays
- "Per Diem"; linked to every day on tour

You can use the prefills with the most common agreement items, or you can custom-create your own.

Lastly, if you have agreements with a crew member or supplier that are based on a flat, fixed fee, independent of the type of day, you can add agreement items called "fixed" or "rental" and indicate the total amount.

#### Planning
In the planning part, you can plan a crew member in 2 ways:
1. You can indicate the day types that a crew member will be working on (for example, someone is only working on show days). To do this, you can simply check or un-check the day types.
2. You can indicate where the crew members' planning deviates from the tour schedule (for example, someone is working every day type of a tour, except for the last show day and travel day because of earlier commitments. To do this, click "plan or unplan specific days in the tour calendar" and indicate that these 2 days need to be removed from the planning for this specific crew member.


### Sharing
As a tour organizer, you can invite people to work with you on a tour by sharing them an agreement.
Before sharing, you'll have the option to add the following things:
* A tag number - used to identify specific crew members and to sort
* Terms and conditions - when a crew member or supplier accepts the agreement, they will automatically also accept the terms and conditions
* A form - when you need to collect more information from your crew member (e.g passport information), you can add a form. Also see [here](https://app.partofthepack.com/faq/agreement-collaboration)
  
As a crew member or supplier, you have the choice to either accept or decline the agreement, or to ask for changes. Also see [here](https://app.partofthepack.com/faq/welcome-supplier)
Apart from that, either side has the possibility to add remarks through the 'give feedback' button.

Every change that was made to the agreement is mentioned to the other party by means of a notification in the app. 
Additionally, the current status of the agreement is at all times shown in your agreement overview page.
