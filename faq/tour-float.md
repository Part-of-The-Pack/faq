Excellent question! We're really proud of this feature!

#### What is Tour Float?
Tour Float is a feature that allows you to upload funds to The Pack, that you can then use to make payments instantly. 

#### Why is this important?
Because on tour, every bank transfer that needs to be initiated takes time and limits visibility within the artist team.

#### Who should use this?
Anyone who is paying crew members or suppliers on The Pack can use it. (Looking at you, managers, accountants and tour managers!)

### How does it work?
You top-up the Tour Float through a simple bank transfer.
The funds become visible on The Pack as soon as the transaction is processed by your bank. 
From then onwards, you can select the Tour Float as the payment method in the regular payment flow, and click pay. Done.

#### How do I top up my Tour Float?
Simple! 
Find the button that says "Add Funds" on the homepage or under The Pack Pay.
When you click that button, select the currency you want to upload. You'll get an IBAN number and a BIC code that you can use as the destination for a regular bank transfer.
