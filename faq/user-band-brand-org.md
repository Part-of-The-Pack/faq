### What are users? {#what-are-users}

A **User** is what you need to log in to The Pack; it is how we know who you are.

For example: Paul McCartney is a user, who registers with paul@thebeatles.com and password YellowSubmarine


### What are organizations?  {#what-are-organizations}

An **Organization** is a financial entity; it is registered, and has a bank account. Users can have access to multiple organizations, and when you complete the onboarding process on Stripe, you create an organization.

For example: The Beatles Incorporated is a company. Note that Paul can belong to multiple companies; he also has Mccartney Limited as a company, that he uses for his solo work.


### What is a B(r)and? {#what-is-a-b-r-and}

A Band or Brand (We like to call this ‘**B(r)and**’) is the name under which organizations operate and want to be found by others on The Pack. Organizations can have multiple bands or brands.

For example: ‘The Beatles’ is the band under which ‘The Beatles Incorporated’ operates. Paul’s organization ‘Mccartney Limited’ goes to market under 2 different brand names: ‘Paul Mccartney Solo’ for his solo albums and ‘DJ Paul’ when he’s DJ’ing at techno raves.
