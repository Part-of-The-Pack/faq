Right before you begin creating a tour, you should select the b(r)and under which you want to create this tour.

People [with access to this b(r)and](https://app.partofthepack.com/faq/brand-members-settings) will be able to collaborate with you on this tour - depending on which access rights they have.

Members with "Manage" access will be able to do anything, including removing tours.

Members with "Edit" access will be able to edit the tour details, but won't be able to remove it.

Members with "View" access will be able to view tours but nothing else.

Members with "No access" won't see any of the tours you have created.
