The Pack was founded with a mission to make tour budgeting and finances more efficient and help live music artists and their teams become more financially successful.

It was inspired by the hands-on experience in tour management - and afterwards in running a tour management agency - of one of our co-founders. Fed up with long hours spent on budgeting and advancing, he dreamt of a more automated future, and The Pack was born.

We want to create a world with more great live shows to attend.

If we can reduce the time spent on budgeting and administrative tasks we can give artists, tour managers and crew more time to focus on what matters: improving the live experience.

In addition, we hope that our software makes it easier for new talent to become involved in the music industry and increase the talent pool; from tour accountants to tour managers and roadies!
