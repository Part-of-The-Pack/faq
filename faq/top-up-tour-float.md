#### Adding Funds yourself:
First off, topping up your Tour Float on The Pack is pretty simple.
You just have to find the button that says "Add Funds" on the homepage or under The Pack Pay.
When you click that button, select the currency you want to upload. 
You'll get an IBAN number and a BIC code that you can use as the destination for a regular bank transfer.

So just log into your bank, and make a transfer to that account. 
Please note that The Pack uses separate accounts for different currencies. So if you want to upload dollars, don't forget to select the "dollar" option on the "add funds" screen. 

#### Having someone else add funds:
... is a possibility!
As long as you share the IBAN number and BIC code with those people, they can add funds on your behalf.

So, say you're a tour manager who is (partially) responsible for payments, but you're not the holder of the bank account.
You could ask the business manager or artist to add funds to The Pack (by means of a simple bank transfer). Once they did that, you now can make payments from that Tour Float until the funds have been depleted.
