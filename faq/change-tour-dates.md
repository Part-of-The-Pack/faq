Luckily, changing the dates of a tour you already created is not very hard - although we did hide it a little bit in order to ensure no mistakes are made!

Here are the simple steps to follow:

1. Open the tour you want to change the dates of
2. Click the botton on top that says "Edit tour configuration"
3. Click the date you want the tour to **start**
4. Click the date you want the tour to **end**
5. Click the big red "update" button at the bottom

**Warning**:
If there are days that you already configured that fall outside of your new tour dates, that configuration will be erased.
So please be careful when editing the tour dates of a tour you already put work in!
