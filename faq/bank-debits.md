Bank Debit payments basically allow the business you want to pay to directly pull funds from your account, after you have authorized them to do so. \
One of the advantages of this method is that the transaction costs are generally lower than for e.g. credit cards.

Because the banks need to process the request, it takes a few days extra before funds leave your account; for SEPA and ACH for example it adds about 5 days to the timeline.
