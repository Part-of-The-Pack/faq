# Some people I work with are not yet on The Pack. How can I do business with them?
One of the best things about The Pack, is that all of your agreements are in one place. If you're working with a crew member, supplier, etc, that is not yet on The Pack, it is best to invite that person on The Pack.

## How can I invite someone to The Pack?
You can invite someone to use The Pack in different ways:

 - If you make an agreement for someone who is not yet on The Pack, you get the chance to invite him. When the user accepts the invitation, he is automatically linked to your agreement.
 - If you want to pay someone who is not yet on The Pack, you can invite that person directly from your payment. When the user accepts the invitation, you can proceed with paying him/her.
 - Do you want someone to work together with you on the same b(r)and? Invite this person to become a part of your b(r)and.

## Why would my coworkers want to join The Pack?
The Pack makes life much easier for everyone involved in a tour. Some of the key benefits:
- **Automation**: Invoices and expense receipts are automatically categorized after uploading, reducing the need for dropboxes and excels.

- **Centralized Communication**: All interactions and updates are in one place, reducing the need for email exchanges.

- **Notification System**: Both you and your crew and suppliers receive email notifications whenever there are changes to your agreements.
- 
- **Clarity**: For those with access rights, budget vs actuals reporting becomes a breeze, in a clear reporting interface.

- **Transparency**: Every change and update is documented, ensuring clear communication and accountability.

- **Efficiency**: Streamline the management process, saving time and reducing the risk of miscommunication.
 
The Pack is free to use for crew members who get invited to agreements by the way, so no worries about costs from that angle!
