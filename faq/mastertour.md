Not really.

Mastertour is a great tool, used by many professionals in the live music industry, especially for the nitty-gritty day-to-day operations of the tour. They are great at providing things like callsheets, guest list management, storing flight details for the whole crew etc.

 

The value of The Pack starts _before_ Mastertour becomes relevant - we are there to help you easily plan tour budgets at the very start of the tour through The Pack Tour, and persists _after_ their job ends - where we make handling all financial transactions frictionless through The Pack Pay.

 

Very soon we will also provide more reporting features and accounting integrations, effectively providing a 360ยบ tour accounting software platform.
