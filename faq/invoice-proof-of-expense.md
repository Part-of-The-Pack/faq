Yes you can!

You can add as many attachments as you like, actually.

For example, if you want to add an invoice with your dayrates and a different which contain only your Per Diems, that is no problem at all.

If you want to add expenses as well, we'd recommend to use the **"Add expense"** button, which you can see under your agreement.

This feature allows you to upload expense receipts in bulk (as many as you want!), after which the platform will extract the most important information (date, supplier, price, category) as much as possible. You can then edit those fields and/or add comments. No more messing about with adding expense receipts to your invoice, this is much easier!
