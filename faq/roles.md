When you add an expense to your tour, we will ask you to assign a category to each expense.

Examples of expenses can be "Lighting Tech", "Splitter Van", "FOH Engineer", "Insurance" or "Artist Manager", 

We have an extensive list of possible expenses, and we have included both the general category (e.g. "Crew Wages") and detailed roles in the list.

The best way to use these is to simply **start typing your desired category** in the field, and select the one that resembles your search best.

#### General Expense Categories

The general categories are the following:
- Wages
- Per Diem
- Accomodation
- Travel
- Production Logistics
- Audio
- Lights
- Video
- Backline
- Set & Stage
- Rigging
- Production Costs
- Catering
- Admin
- Marketing & Promotion
- Merchandise
- Insurance
- Artist Wages
- Management & Agency Fees
- Visa & Work Permits
- Accounting & Legal
- Taxes
- Miscellaneous

#### Detailed Expense Categories

You'll find lots of detailed categories linked to each of these general ones (e.g. Carnet bond, Travel insurance,...)
In the reporting, expenses you've linked to a detailed category will automatically be reported under the correct general category as well. 
E.g. if you've classified something as Travel insurance, it will be reported under Insurance.

#### Crew Roles

We know that for large tours with lots of crew, you will want to specify roles in detail... And for tours with a small crew, a general role makes more sense.
That is why we have included both a list of general categories that you can use to name your roles, as well as a more detailed breakdown under each service.
