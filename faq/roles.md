When you add crew to your tour, we will ask you to assign a role to each crew member.

Examples of roles can be "Lighting Tech", "FOH Engineer", or "Artist Manager".

 

We know that for large tours with lots of crew, you will want to specify roles in detail... And for tours with a small crew, a general role makes more sense.

That is why we have included both a list of general services that you can use to name your roles, as well as a more detailed breakdown under each service.

 

General **services** include artist services, audio production, backline, catering and hospitality, event logistics management, health, safety and welfare, lasers, SFX and pyro, lighting, load in/load out crew, merchandiser, performers, production coordination, staging and set design, transport, and video.
