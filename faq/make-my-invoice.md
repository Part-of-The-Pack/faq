Yes we can!

**If you are a crew member based in the United States**, or if you need an invoice that complies with US legislation, we can help you!
You can simply drop us an email at helpdesk@partofthepack.com, ideally including a link to the tour / agreement you want your invoice for.

You can also use the chat by clicking the little square speech bubble icon at the bottom of the page.

We will reach out to you with any additional questions we might have within 12 hours, and you'll get your invoice in 24h at most. Mostly, much quicker.

Note that we base your invoice on the agreement that you have on The Pack with your counterpart (the payor). 
In other words, please make sure the agreement is fully up-to-date and correct before you request an invoice from us :)  

**If you are a tour organizer that needs invoices for crew members** that comply with US legislation, we can also help you.
Feel free to follow the process above, but tell us that you need invoices for all your crew members (or a subset of them) on a particular tour and we'll get to work for you.
