We try to make it easy for you by linking your planning to your expense.
This implies that whenever your tour planning changes, your agreement will auto-update as well.
You also can always change the planning for an expense, for example for a crew member, by excluding certain days or day types from their tour schedule.

However, we understand that sometimes you need to make a certain cost outside of the indicated tour schedule.

For example, you might want to make sure your audio engineers are planned for a specific setup day prior to the start of the tour, or you get an invoice from your VJ for a programming day a week before the actual tour schedule starts.

For this purpose, you can pin days to, or exclude days from *expense items*. 
This "unlinks" a date from the day type, and fixates it for this specific expense item until you manually remove this configuration.

This feature allows you to go outside of the tour schedule (you could theoretically pin an expense item to October 18, 1926), so treat this with care!

#### How does it work?

You can do this in a couple of easy steps:
* Within an expense, add a new expense item
* Click "show to which days this item applies" - you'll notice a calendar will appear
* Click the day you want to pin this expense item to. Don't forget to unselect "all tour days" if you only want to pin this to one or more specific days outside the tour schedule
* Click "more options"
* Click "pin day to agreement item"
* Close the pop up
* Verify in the calendar that you've correctly pinned the day. You'll see a small "+" icon appear next to the date.
* Fill out the rest of the expense item as desired
* When filling out the rate, don't forget to set the "Type of rate" to "day"
* Click "add to expense"
* Click save and close once your expense has been finalized.
