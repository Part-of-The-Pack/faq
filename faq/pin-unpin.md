We try to make it easy for you by linking day types to contract items - which implies that whenever your tour planning changes, your contracts will auto-update as well.


However, we understand that sometimes you want to make sure a specific crew member works on a specific day.

For example, you might want to make sure your audio engineers are planned for a specific setup day prior to the start of the tour.

Or, there might be one specific show in a smaller venue where you only need part of the crew, and you give the rest of them an off day.

 

For this purpose, you can pin or exclude days to a contract item. This "unlinks" this day from the day type, and fixates it for this specific contract item until you manually remove this configuration.
