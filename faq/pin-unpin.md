We try to make it easy for you by linking day types to agreement items - which implies that whenever your tour planning changes, your agreement will auto-update as well.
You also can always change the planning for an individual tour member, excluding certain days or day types from their tour schedule.


However, we understand that sometimes you need to make a certain cost outside of the indicated tour schedule.

For example, you might want to make sure your audio engineers are planned for a specific setup day prior to the start of the tour, or you get an invoice from your VJ for a programming day a week before the actual tour schedule starts.

For this purpose, you can pin days to, or exclude days from agreement item. 
This "unlinks" this day from the day type, and fixates it for this specific agreement item until you manually remove this configuration.

This feature allows you to go outside of the tour schedule (you could theoretically pin a agreement item to October 18, 1926), so treat this with care!
