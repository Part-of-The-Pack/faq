This depends on the type of payment you choose when checking out.

#### Card payments

The short summary is: we don’t do anything differently with card payments than what you’re already used to on other platforms.

With Card Payments, the transaction is processed instantly. However, as you likely know, when you use a debit card the money leaves your account instantly, while on a credit card the cost is booked to the credit card account but the settlement thereof depends entirely on how you’ve set it up.

  


#### Bank Debits (e.g SEPA, ACH,...)

Bank Debit payments basically allow the business you want to pay to directly pull funds from your account, after you have authorized them to do so.

One of the advantages of this method is that the transaction costs are generally lower than for e.g. credit cards.

Because the banks need to process the request, it takes a few days extra before funds leave your account; for SEPA and ACH for example it adds about 5 days to the timeline.
