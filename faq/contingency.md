Oh hell yes!

We know sometimes you need to budget in a little bit of contingency to take care of the unexpected on tour.
So we built in the possibility to add a contingency directly in your agreement items. And we've heard some agencies use it to add markup to their budgets as well.

#### How to add contingency to agreement items:

1. When creating an agreement item, click "advanced settings"
2. Choose between a percentage or fixed contingency.
3. Edit the percentage amount (use whole numbers, e.g. type "10" for 10% contingency) or type in the fixed fee
4. Click "update agreement item" on the bottom of the page

#### Where will I see the contingency amounts?
You'll see them in a few places:

1. On agreement item level
2. On agreement level in the summary (you'll see a sum of all the contingencies you added on all items)
3. On tour budget level (you'll see a sum of all the contingencies you added on all agreements)

#### Who can see the contingencies?

1. Crew members or suppliers **can not see contingencies**. 
When you share an agreement with the crew member or supplier, they only see the rate without contingency. This makes it easy for agencies to pay their subcontractors a net amount, while invoicing a net+fee amount towards their clients. And you may not want to communicate to your crew members that you've budgeted for some unforeseen costs as part of the agreement you have with them :)
2. People with access to the tour organizer b(r)and on The Pack **will** be able to see contingencies. 
  
#### Can I report contingencies separately?

Absolutely. 
When you export your report from The Pack, you'll get 3 separate columns:

1. The net cost (= e.g. what you pay your crew member, let's say a dayrate of $500)
2. The contingency (= e.g. 10% on top of the dayrate, so $50)
3. The total cost (= net + contingency, meaning $550)

This gives you total flexibility to report net costs and contingency/margin for your tour and across multiple tours as well.
