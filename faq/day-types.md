Day types are basically the main thing that will happen during a tour day.

You can choose between 5 day types currently:


*Show day*: the most exciting day of the tour - where the magic happens and the live show is performed


*Travel day*: when your only purpose is moving from point a to b


*Rehearsal day*: when you're getting ready for the big performance


*Prep day*: when you're preparing the performance in any other way


*Off day*: the second most exciting day of the tour, when your only mission is to chill and catch up on sleep

Specifying your day types in the calendar make your life easy later on when you're adding agreement items, which can be linked to your day types.
