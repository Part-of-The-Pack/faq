# How do I link payments to a Tour?
Even if The Pack makes it easy to request payments through existing agreements, it will happen once in a while that a payment or a payment request reaches you without being linked to a specific agreement or a specific tour.

## Why is it necessary to link payments to a tour?
In order for your tour budget to be up to date at any moment, it is best to link those payments to the right agreement. That way, you always have a good overview of what you're paying for, and of which payments are still due.

## How to link a payment to a tour
When you receive a payment that is not yet linked to a tour, you can immediately link it to the correct tour by clicking on 'Link payment to an agreement' in the payment details. In the screen that pops up, select the right tour and agreement and click on the red button. Off course, in order to do this, you need [sufficient access rights to Pay and Tour](https://app.partofthepack.com/faq/brand-members-settings).

When you receive a payment that is linked to an incorrect agreement, first unlink the payment and then link it to the correct agreement.

## How to match payments to an agreement
Do you have a virtual pile of loose payments? You can match them to your agreements as follows:
On the agreement details page of any tours you are managing, you will see a 'match payments' button. Click on it to match unlinked payments to the agreement.
