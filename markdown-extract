# The Basics

The core concepts that are useful to understand in order to use The Pack efficiently


## What is The Pack again?

The Pack is the platform that helps Artist Teams do Business; whether you’re an artist, an artist manager, a freelance sound engineer, a tour manager or anyone else involved in the music business - we are here for you.

Our focus is to help you easily plan tour budgets through The Pack Tour and make transactions frictionless through The Pack Pay.


## What is The Pack Tour?

The Pack Tour aims to make the financial side of tour planning easy.

It was built based on the firsthand observation that planning tour finances is complex and involves a lot of different people and constant changes.

By using Tour, you can collaborate with others on budgets, agree on fees and create custom contracts for all crew members, and always keep an overview of how the financial side of the tour is looking.


## What is The Pack Pay?

The Pack Pay aims to make transactions easy.

It was built based on the firsthand observation that artist teams and freelancers spend a lot of time emailing invoices back and forth and making payments manually through bank accounts. We want to help them (you!) claim that time back so you can spend it on crowd-pleasing activities instead :).


## What is the difference between a User, a Band or Brand and an Organization?


### What are users?

A User is what you need to log in to The Pack; it is how we know who you are.

**For example: Paul McCartney is a user, who registers with paul@thebeatles.com and password YellowSubmarine**

 


### What are organizations?

An Organization is a financial entity; it is registered, and has a bank account. Users can have access to multiple organizations, and when you complete the onboarding process on Stripe, you create an organization.

**For example: The Beatles Incorporated is a company. Note that Paul can belong to multiple companies; he also has Mccartney Limited as a company, that he uses for his solo work.**

 


### What is a B(r)and?

A Band or Brand (We like to call this ‘B(r)and’) is the name under which organizations operate and want to be found by others on The Pack. Organizations can have multiple bands or brands.

**For Example: ‘The Beatles’ is the band under which ‘The Beatles Incorporated’ operates. Paul’s organization ‘Mccartney Limited’ goes to market under 2 different brand names: ‘Paul Mccartney Solo’ for his solo albums and ‘DJ Paul’ when he’s DJ’ing at techno raves.**

 


## How much does it cost to use The Pack?

In short, access to the platform is free.

We only charge a fee if you _pay_ invoices, no costs if you _get paid_.

 


### Using The Pack Tour...

... is 100% free, no strings attached.

 


### Getting paid on The Pack Pay

Getting paid by your clients is 100% free: you can send and receive payment requests and invoices for free, and we won’t charge you anything.

 


### Paying on The Pack Pay

When you pay through The Pack Pay, we charge a 1% platform cost. This amount helps us keep the servers up and running and supports new feature development like e.g. improvements to The Pack Tour etc.

In addition, depending on the payment type you choose, you’ll be charged a fee by the payment provider that’s used.

We transparently show you the fees on the checkout page, and you will see that when you select different payment types, the fees change. We try to make it cheaper for you by ranking the payment types available to you by price (the cheapest option first!).

We only keep the 1%, the other fees go directly to the payment providers.

 


## Is The Pack a tour management software platform like for example Mastertour?

Not really.

Mastertour is a great tool, used by many professionals in the live music industry, especially for the nitty-gritty day-to-day operations of the tour. They are great at providing things like callsheets, guest list management, storing flight details for the whole crew etc.

 

The value of The Pack starts _before_ Mastertour becomes relevant - we are there to help you easily plan tour budgets at the very start of the tour through The Pack Tour, and persists _after_ their job ends - where we make handling all financial transactions frictionless through The Pack Pay.

 

Very soon we will also provide more reporting features and accounting integrations, effectively providing a 360º tour accounting software platform.

# The Pack Tour

Specific questions about The Pack Tour


## How can I collaborate with others on tour creation?

Right before you begin creating a tour, you should select the b(r)and under which you want to create this tour.

People with access to this b(r)and will be able to collaborate with you on this tour - depending on which access rights they have.

Members with "Manage" access will be able to do anything, including removing tours.

Members with "Edit" access will be able to edit the tour details, but won't be able to remove it.

Members with "View" access will be able to view tours but nothing else.

Members with "No access" won't see any of the tours you have created.


## What are roles?

When you add crew to your tour, we will ask you to assign a role to each crew member.

Examples of roles can be "Lighting Tech", "FOH Engineer", or "Artist Manager".

 

We know that for large tours with lots of crew, you will want to specify roles in detail... And for tours with a small crew, a general role makes more sense.

Silly jokes aside, professions include: agent, artist, artist manager, crew, festival organizer, industry body, production company, promotor, record label, supplier rental company, and venue.


## What are day types?

Day types are basically the main thing that will happen during a tour day.

You can choose between 4 day types currently:


    Show day: the most exciting day of the tour - where the magic happens and the live show is performed


    Travel day: when your only purpose is moving from point a to b


    Rehearsal day: when you're getting ready for the big performance


    Off day: the second most exciting day of the tour, when your only mission is to chill and catch up on sleep

Specifying your day types in the calendar make your life easy later on when you're adding contract items, which can be linked to your day types.


## What are contract items?

Contract items are agreements between the organizer of a tour and a crew member regarding the fees that crew member will be paid.

Contract items can be linked to different types of tour days. For example, you can add a contract item specifically for show days or travel days, after which the platform will automatically calculate the totals based on the calendar of tour days you have created.

You can add multiple contract items to an agreement.

You can use the prefills with the most common contract items, or you can custom-create your own.


## What does it mean to pin or exclude days in a contract item?

We try to make it easy for you by linking day types to contract items - which implies that whenever your tour planning changes, your contracts will auto-update as well.

 

However, we understand that sometimes you want to make sure a specific crew member works on a specific day.

For example, you might want to make sure your audio engineers are planned for a specific setup day prior to the start of the tour.

Or, there might be one specific show in a smaller venue where you only need part of the crew, and you give the rest of them an off day.

 

For this purpose, you can pin or exclude days to a contract item. This "unlinks" this day from the day type, and fixates it for this specific contract item until you manually remove this configuration.


# The Pack Pay

Specific questions about The Pack Pay


## How long does it take before the payments I make leave my account?

This depends on the type of payment you choose when checking out.

 


### Card payments

The short summary is: we don’t do anything differently with card payments than what you’re already used to on other platforms.

With Card Payments, the transaction is processed instantly. However, as you likely know, when you use a debit card the money leaves your account instantly, while on a credit card the cost is booked to the credit card account but the settlement thereof depends entirely on how you’ve set it up.

  


### Bank Debits (e.g SEPA, ACH,...)

Bank Debit payments basically allow the business you want to pay to directly pull funds from your account, after you have authorized them to do so.

One of the advantages of this method is that the transaction costs are generally lower than for e.g. credit cards.

Because the banks need to process the request, it takes a few days extra before funds leave your account; for SEPA and ACH for example it adds about 5 days to the timeline.

All information on how Bank Debits work can be found[ here](https://stripe.com/en-es/guides/introduction-to-bank-debits) on the Strip help center. An overview of timelines per Bank Debit type can be found[ here](https://stripe.com/en-es/guides/introduction-to-bank-debits#comparison-of-global-bank-debit-methods).


## How long does it take before payments made to me reach my account?

We know you want your money as soon as possible, so we’re trying to ensure this doesn’t take too long!

There are a few different answers to this question though, so please read on.

 


### A normal timeline depends on your country.

The exact amount of days between a payment is made and the time it hits your bank account varies by country. Generally, it’s about 3 days. You can read the detailed information about this on the Stripe help center here.

  


### The first time is different…

The first time a transaction is made to you on The Pack, our trusted partner Stripe needs to verify a few things in the background to ensure it’s a legitimate payment and no fraud is happening. As a result, the first time it takes between 7 and 14 days before the money will hit your account. This _only _happens the very first time, and after that we’re on to approximately 3 days (as explained above) \
 


### Bank Debits (SEPA, ACH,...) are a bit special.

When your client pays you through a Bank Debit, they basically authorize your bank to take the amount directly from their bank account.

Because the banks need to process the request, it takes a few days extra before money actually hits your account. For SEPA and ACH for example it adds about 5 days to the timeline.

We keep you informed of every step in the timeline in the following ways:

 

    _Step 1_: When your customer has initiated the Bank Debit process, we send you an email to let you know the payment is processing. You will also see the status ‘processing’ next to the payment request on The Pack Pay.

    _Step 2_: When the processing is done about 5 days later, you will get a second email to tell you that you’ve been paid. And, we will mark the payment request on The Pack Pay as ‘paid’

 


## What do I do if payments are not reaching me, although I’ve waited the time described above?

In very rare circumstances, a payment is held back until Stripe verifies some of your information.

 

To determine if this is happening and solve this, there are 3 things you can do:


    First: Check your inbox to see if you’ve received an email from Stripe directly with next steps.


    Alternatively, log in to The Pack, go to ‘settings’ > ‘my brands’ > select the brand you’re waiting on a payment for > click ‘Go to Stripe’. This will log you into stripe and tell you what they need in order to unblock your payment.


    If all else fails, contact support@stripe.com.


## Can I add invoices or proof of expenses to my payment requests?

Yes you can!

You can add as many attachments as you like, actually.

So if you want to add up all your expenses to one big amount, and then upload all the receipts to prove those expenses in one go (instead of making a lot of smaller requests), you can totally do that.


## Someone requested a payment from me, but I don’t agree with it. What should I do?

You have the ability to either decline the payment completely, or to request changes directly on the platform. Easy!


## I have requested a payment from someone, but I just remembered I need to make changes. Can I do that?

Absolutely. Just click into the payment request, click ‘update payment request’, and make any necessary changes. You can also cancel the payment request completely by clicking (wait for it) ‘cancel’. 


## I have approved a payment, but I need to recall it because I made a mistake. What now?

Absolutely. Even when a payment is approved, you can still request changes by clicking the ‘request changes’ button and filling out the changes you’re looking for in the open text field.

Alternatively, you can also still decline the payment by clicking the ‘decline’ button.


## Is there a limit on the amount of transactions I can request or pay?

xxxxxxxx

 


## How do the ‘payment terms’ work?

The payment terms indicate when payment is due relative to the date on which goods or services were delivered, or when your invoice for those goods or services was delivered.

You can choose between a few options of payment terms to send along with your invoice, the shortest being "7 days" and the longest "60 days".


## I use a different entity (company) to book incomes from my band in different countries; how do I make this happen on The Pack?

No worries, we have heard this one before!

For example, we have European bands on The Pack who have a separate entity for their business in the United States, which could be interesting for tax reasons.

 

To make this happen on The Pack, you should simply set up a company for every separate entity you operate, and create a uniquely named band under every company.

 

_For example, user Till Lindeman would create ‘Rammstein EU inc’ and ‘Rammstein US inc’ and create band ‘Rammstein EU’ and ‘Rammstein US’ under each respective company. Whenever there’s a US tour, Till would make sure all transactions happen with Rammstein US._

 


# Stripe

A couple of words about our payment partner Stripe


## Why am I being referred to something called ‘Stripe’ during the setup of my profile?

Stripe is the trusted service we use to handle payments in the backend. It has an excellent reputation for being a secure payments platform, and many companies like booking.com and ticketswap use it. You can find out more about stripe on[ www.stripe.com](http://www.stripe.com/).

If you need help with Stripe, their help center can be found at[ https://support.stripe.com/](https://support.stripe.com/) 


## Why do I need to fill out all those fields on Stripe?

In order to be able to receive payments, you need to complete your Stripe signup.

Stripe needs to collect those fields to comply with among others the European Union regulations regarding money transfers.

Given that Stripe also needs to comply with privacy regulations in all the territories they are active in (e.g. GDPR in the EU), we are confident your data is safe with them.

You can find out more about their privacy approach at[ https://support.stripe.com/topics/privacy](https://support.stripe.com/topics/privacy)


## I have a problem with verification of my Stripe account, now what?

We’re sorry to hear it!

This[ link](https://support.stripe.com/topics/verification) on the Stripe help center should have all the information you’re looking for.

If it doesn’t, please let us know at helpdesk@partofthepack.com so we can help you to figure it out!


# About The Pack

Some background information about The Pack


## Where is The Pack from?

The Pack is incorporated in 2 places: in Europe in Gent, Belgium and in the United States in Claremont, California.

Our 3 founders are Belgian, 2 of them living in Belgium and 1 of them living in Madrid, Spain.


## Why did you start a tour budgeting software platform?

The Pack was founded with a mission to make tour budgeting and finances more efficient and help live music artists and their teams become more financially successful.

We want to create a world with more great live shows to attend.

If we can reduce the time spent on budgeting and administrative tasks we can give artists, tour managers and crew more time to focus on what matters: improving the live experience.

In addition, we hope that our software makes it easier for new talent to become involved in the music industry and increase the talent pool; from tour accountants to tour managers and roadies!
