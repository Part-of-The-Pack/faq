# Webapp CMS

## What and why?

This project is used as a CMS for the rich content related parts of our webapp.

This came to existance when we needed a dynamic FAQ, with search, tags and videos.

It can be used mainly for the content:

- That contains mostly text and are generated by our non-technical people
- That embed loom videos

## Current usage

### FAQ folder

The faq folder relates to all content on the website and webapp [FAQ](https://app.partofthepack.com/faq).

## How?

Create pages in markdown. You can use all rich markdown features [cfr StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app).
In fact, you can even use StackEdit to create your pages and then copy paste it into github here.

### Update FAQ section

Every time a new change is pushed to this main branch, a webhook gets triggered to refresh the FAQ data on the website.

### Metadata

Every article should contain some metadata

- title: Mandatory title of the page
- subtitle: Optional subtitle
- type:
  - question: In the case of FAQ, all the questions are added to the FAQ pages
  - intro: It should only contain one, and that is the intro of the FAQ home screen
  - outro: It should only contain one, and that is the outro of the FAQ home screen
- tags: This can contain a list of tags that are used on the FAQ website to filter easily
